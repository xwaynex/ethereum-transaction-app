# Ethereum Transaction Web App

This web app enables users to send Ethereum along with a message and a GIF to any wallet address globally. It's built with a Solidity smart contract and uses the latest technologies—**Hardhat** for contract development and **Ethers.js v6** for seamless integration with the **React.js** frontend.

## About the Project
This project is a decentralized web application where users can:
- Connect their MetaMask wallet.
- Send Ethereum to another wallet address along with a message and GIF.
- View their transactions with metadata like sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, and message.

The project uses **Hardhat** for local Ethereum development, **Ethers.js v6** for contract interactions, and **React.js** for a responsive, user-friendly frontend.

## Built With
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) - For writing the Ethereum smart contract.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - For local blockchain development and contract deployment.
- [Ethers.js v6](https://docs.ethers.io/v6/) - For interacting with the Ethereum network.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - For building the frontend interface.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - For wallet integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) - Required to run the frontend and development server.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - Browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - For running a local Ethereum network and deploying the smart contract.

### Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xwaynex/ethereum-transaction-app.git
cd ethereum-transaction-app
npm install
```

## Smart Contract Development

### Project Setup
In the project root, you'll find a `contracts` folder with the Solidity contract that handles Ethereum transactions. The contract code is written in Solidity and enables sending Ethereum from one address to another, with a message and timestamp.

### Deploying the Contract
1. Ensure Hardhat is installed:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```

2. Start a local blockchain in a new terminal:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

3. Deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

After deployment, take note of the contract address, which you’ll use to connect the frontend to the smart contract.

## Frontend Development

### Setting Up Ethers.js
We use **Ethers.js v6** for handling Ethereum interactions in the frontend. In this project, `Ethers.js` is used to connect to MetaMask, read the contract, and call functions.

Install **Ethers.js**:
```bash
npm install ethers
```

### Integrating with the Smart Contract
In `TransactionContext.jsx`, we set up our Ethereum provider, connect to MetaMask, and instantiate the contract to interact with its functions. Key methods in this integration include:
- **`connectWallet`**: Connects MetaMask to the dApp.
- **`sendTransaction`**: Sends Ethereum along with a message and keyword to generate a GIF.
- **`getAllTransactions`**: Retrieves all transactions from the contract.

Update the contract address in the frontend with the address from your deployment.

### Testing the Transaction Flow
1. Connect MetaMask to the local blockchain (default Hardhat network).
2. Use the frontend interface to send transactions. You should see the Ethereum transaction, message, and GIF reflected on the blockchain.
3. View transaction history.

## Usage
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click on "Connect Wallet" to authenticate with MetaMask.
2. **Send Transaction**: Enter the recipient's address, amount, a keyword for the GIF, and a message.
3. **View Transactions**: All transactions with details like sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp will be displayed on the page.

## Features
- **Decentralized Transactions**: Direct Ethereum transfers from sender to receiver.
- **GIF Messaging**: Enter a keyword to send a GIF along with your transaction.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Securely connect your wallet and interact with the dApp.
- **Transaction History**: View your transaction details for better traceability.
